# Lifelong Learning

---

## As IT Pros, Learning is Essential...

Note:
We are, after all, knowledge workers, in a demanding profession. Companies are and want to move fast , and that requires skilled professionals. Being a highly skilled can bring along many advantages - more enjoyable work, more fulfilling work, maybe more money as you progress.

---

## ... but it's also Time consuming

Note:
It's not hard; It's actually enjoyable and a part of the "optimal experience" (Csikszentmihalyi); But we are busy with everyday things and get lost in our ability to focus on aquiring new skills.

---

# The 5-Hour Rule

---

## Making time to learn is even Harder

Note:
Finding time is hard. 8 hour days, comutes, and a work-life balance to manage. Bills to pay.
´
---

## And Tech is changing right in front of us.. 
# ALL THE TIME

Note:
So much is going on, and there is only so much we can get through. It is overwellming at least. Scary too. 

---

## cognitive overload
## imposter syndrome
## burnout

Note:
We can't really learn everything. It's unfourtunate, but there is too much going on that we won't really get anywhere if we try to ingest everything at once. AND THAT IS OK!

It's something that needs to be acknowledged and accepted. This doesn't mean we should stop learning cause we're never gonna get to everything. It just means that we should be miving forward and evolving, knowning we are going to continuously improve our selves.

#The challenge

## #IsWhatIllLearnAboutIn2018 
## #ImGoingToLearn

Note:
Get your twitter app ready and type in tha hash tag .

---

## Choose a topic - one is enough 

<span class="byline">(hint: it's better than 0)</span>

Note:
It's like the Kanban WIP. Too much at the same time means nothing get's done.

---

## Learn that topic in 2018

Note:
Focus your searches on that topic. Read and inest enough to know about it, enough to apply it and bring it into you day-to-day work. Or event to discover new topics to move through.

---

#I'll Help with some topics

Note:
We'll break them down into areas, You choose what you feel would be the most benficial to you short / mid / long term (choose one). If your feeling brave, choose more, but don't over do it. But get at least one.

### you can choose topics that are not on this list

---

### and you should commit to it throughout the year

---

### ...but it's OK to change throughout the year

(that's ok)

---

## Sounds easy right?

---

## I hear too often "I don't have the time"

(I sometimes say it too)

---

# How to find the time?

---

## Some techniques:

### Lunch and Learn
### Group gatherings
### Mix activities
### Mix it into work
### You time (schedule It)

(mix and match)

---

## Lunch and Learn
### (classic definition)

Note:
Someone brings a theme and a short presentations, and presents at lunch hour.
all you need is some projector. everyone typically needs to eat lunch

---

## Lunch and Learn 
### (variation 1)

Note:
Just watch a tutorial or conference presentation at lunch (in group)
0 cost, guaranteed info ingestion

---

## Lunch and Learn 
### (variation 2)

Note:
A bit more formal, and reduced time limite (15)
a.k.a Speed Training

---

## Lunch and Learn

* ~ 40 hours per year of learning if you do it once a week.
* it's 1/5th of the 5-Hour rule

---

## Group Gatherings

Go To Conferences, Workshops and Meetups

Note:
* Our meetup is 2 hours of monthly-ish learning.

--- 

## Group Gatherings (variation 1)

Organize one!

--- 

## Habit of reading books

Note:
Book challenge
* at least one tech book per year / semester / quarter
* fiction plus non fiction
* ‎book group / swap
* start a company library

---

## Mix Activities

Note:
The idea is to do regular daily stuff (not cognitively expensive) with information ingestion

---

## Mix Activities (examples)

* read books on your comute
* listen to podcasts while you drive
* listen to audio books while you excercise
* watch a presentation while you cook
* toilet reading

---

### Mix it into work

If what you want to learn is also what you have to work on at the moment, deliberately perform learning activities 
* tutorials
* Q&A
* blog post reading and indexing
* documenting and sharing learnings
* tweeting

---

### Pairing at work

Learn what other do by working with them, or help them acheive their goals
* a dev can work with ops on on-call duty
* a dev can automate some unautomated process
* a dev can do customer support

Note:
Volunteer for it

---

### Improving at work

* Using 1-on-1s and Mentoring
* Logging work and discoveries
* Learning retrospectives
* Portmortems to blamelessly learning from failure
* 20% time projects or hack-a-thons

---

## You time

### Ultimately, you (may) need to schedule time for learning

Note:
deliberately set the time aside (like a meeting) 

---

# when this gets moving....

---
 
## bring others along for the ride

Note:
Like running, learning efforts can benefit from having others around you, pushing you forward and feeding from your effort.

---

## bring your organization along

Note:
Is your company a learing organization? Can you be the one who helps transform it into one?

---

# Your company IS accountable for your training

Both by law and by interest.

Lobby for your training if you are not getting it.
* get to workshops and conferences
* get them to buy the books
* get them to subsscribe to training sites (Lynda, Pluralsight, Mapt, Safari, Udemy...)

---

# Your company IS accountable for your training

They should be able to afford these things... If not, something is fundamentally wrong.

---
 
# YOU are accountable for your training

You SHOULD buy books and videos
You SHOULD go to confrences and workshops

---

# YOU are accountable for your training

You should be able to afford these things... If not, something is fundamentally wrong. 

---

### You own your career. It solely up to you. Your company may help/ your colleagues and friends may help, but it is up to you...

---

## In 2018, go learn something new!
