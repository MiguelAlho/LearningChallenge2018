## Learning is Essential...
## ... but it's also Time consuming
## eficiently avoid the cognitive overload
## Making time to learn is even Harder
## So much is going on, and there is only so much we can get through

#The challenge
## Choose a topic - one is enough (it's better than 0)
## Learn that topic in 2018
Enough to know about it, enough to apply it and bring it into you day-to-day work

#I'll Help with some topics
## We'll break them down into areas
## You choose what you feel would be the most benficial to you short / mid / long term (choose one)
## If your feeling brave, choose more, but get at least one
