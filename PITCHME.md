#The Quick Intro and Context

---

# The 5-Hour Rule

---

## As IT Pros, Learning is Essential...

We are, after all, knowledge workers, in a demanding profession. Companies are and want to move fast , and that requires skilled professionals. Being a highly skilled can bring along many advantages - more enjoyable work, more fulfilling work, maybe more money as you progress.

---

## ... but it's also Time consuming

It's not hard; It's actually enjoyable and a part of the "optimal experience" (Csikszentmihalyi); But we are busy with everyday things and get lost in our ability to focus on aquiring new skills.

---

## Making time to learn is even Harder

Finding time is hard. 8 hour days, comutes, and a work-life balance to manage. Bills to pay.

---

## And Tech is changing right in front of us.. 
# ALL THE TIME

So much is going on, and there is only so much we can get through. It is overwellming at least. Scary too. 

---

## cognitive overload
## imposter syndrome
## burnout

We can't really learn everything. It's unfourtunate, but there is too much going on that we won't really get anywhere if we try to ingest everything at once. AND THAT IS OK!

It's something that needs to be acknowledged and accepted. This doesn't mean we should stop learning cause we're never gonna get to everything. It just means that we should be miving forward and evolving, knowning we are going to continuously improve our selves.

#The challenge

## #IsWhatIllLearnAboutIn2018

Get your twitter app ready and type in tha hash tag .

---

## Choose a topic - one is enough 

<span class="byline">(hint: it's better than 0)</span>

It's like the Kanban WIP. Too much at the same time means nothing get's done.

---

## Learn that topic in 2018

Focus your searches on that topic. Read and inest enough to know about it, enough to apply it and bring it into you day-to-day work. Or event to discover new topics to move through.

---

#I'll Help with some topics

We'll break them down into areas, You choose what you feel would be the most benficial to you short / mid / long term (choose one). If your feeling brave, choose more, but don't over do it. But get at least one.

### and you can change throughout the year

(that's ok)

# How to find the time

---

## I hear too often "I don't have the time"

(I sometimes say it too)

---

## Some techniques:

### Lunch and Learn
### Speed Trainings
### Meetups
### Coffee Read
### Mix with exercise and driving (PolyActivity)
### Go to a conference(s)
### READ
### Listen to podcasts
### Watch presentations

(mix and match)
---

## Lunch and Learn

(~ 40 hours per year of learning if you do it once a week).

---

## Lunch and Learn

Someone brings a theme and a short presentations, and presents at lunch hour.

all you need is some projector. everyone typically needs to eat lunch

---

## Lunch and Learn (variation)

Just watch a tutorial or conference presentation at lunch (in group)

0 cost, guaranteed info ingestion
