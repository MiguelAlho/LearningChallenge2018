# Lifelong Learning

Note:
* Tap into our own potential - unrealized ability
* We need to have a growth mindset instead of a fixed mindset
* "get better" => continuous improvement 

---

### As IT Pros, learning is 
## ESSENTIAL...

Note:
* We are, after all, knowledge workers, in a demanding profession. 
* Companies are and want to move fast , and that requires skilled professionals. 
* Being a highly skilled can bring along many advantages - more enjoyable work, more fulfilling work, maybe more money as you progress.
* We need to avoid becoming obsolete

---

## ... but it's also time consuming

Note:
* It's not hard; 
* It's actually enjoyable and a part of the "optimal experience" (Csikszentmihalyi); 
* But we are busy with everyday things and get lost in our ability to focus on aquiring new skills.

---

## The 5-Hour Rule
![5 hour rule](assets/images/5hourrulegraph.png)

Note:
* Google it
* I haven't found science around this (mostly observation)
* but it's believe that some are highly active in learning
* And its a great measurable thing to consider for ourselves
* READ - REFLECT - EXPERIMENT

---

## Making time to learn is hard

Note:
Finding time is hard:
* 8-12 hour work days, 
* comutes, 
* kids to care of, 
* a work-life balance to manage.

---

### ... Tech keeps changing right in front of us... 
# ALL THE TIME

Note:
So much is going on, and there is only so much we can get through. It is overwellming at least. Scary too. 

---?image=assets/memes/itsatrap.jpg

Note:
* cognitive overload
* imposter syndrome
* burnout

We can't really learn everything. It's unfourtunate, but there is too much going on that we won't really get anywhere if we try to ingest everything at once. AND THAT IS OK!

It's something that needs to be acknowledged and accepted. This doesn't mean we should stop learning cause we're never gonna get to everything. It just means that we should be miving forward and evolving, knowning we are going to continuously improve our selves.

---

## Let's overcome this...

Note:
Get your twitter app ready and type in tha hash tag .

### Choose a topic - one is enough 

<span class="byline">(hint: it's better than 0)</span>

Note:
It's like the Kanban WIP. Too much at the same time means nothing get's done.

---

## Focus on learning that topic in 2018

Note:
Focus your searches on that topic. Read and ingest enough to know about it, enough to apply it and bring it into you day-to-day work. Or event to discover new topics to move through.

---

## I'll Help with some topics

Note:
We'll break them down into areas, You choose what you feel would be the most benficial to you short / mid / long term (choose one). If your feeling brave, choose more, but don't over do it. But get at least one.

---

* DevOps Practices
* Code Patterns
* Tools
* Value Processes
* People Skills & Personal Development

---

## DevOps Practices

* TDD / BDD
* CI / CD pipelines
* GIT
* Shell language
* Runbooks

Note:
Baseline stuff for devops - choose one of these if they are not a part of your toolbelt yet. They are foundational

---

## DevOps Practices

* Logging, Monitoring and business metrics capturing
* Infrastructure as code
* ‎‎Feature flagging
* Deployment techniques
* DocOps
* Security
* ‎Portmortems
* Game Day activities
* Chaos engineering

Note:
* alot is related to non-functional requirements and often "left behind"
* learn a web tech to be able to build a tolling portal
* mix feature flags and metrics capturing

---

## Application Quality Enhancements

* ‎ADRs
* Living documentation
* Consumer Driven Contracts
* DB testing
* Infrastructure Testing
* Nonfunctional validation
 
---

## ADRs 
#### Architecture Decision Records

<span class="byline lowernote">[https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record)</span>

Note:
* short text file (don't overdo it)
* single decision per file
* Easy to insert practice
* Helps describe changes in a repo / architecture
* Great help for the onboarding process
* Functional + Non Functional
* Context to your change history

* Read Micheal Nygards stuff on this

---

## Consumer Driven Contracts

#### It's like TDD for services

NOTE:
* consumers write expectation
* services test valid 
* what about CDCs for 
    - what about at the shared db layer
    - non http services
* tools like Pact and Pacto help
* check out Beth Skurrie's presentations
---

## Coding Patterns

* ‎CQRS
* Resiliency patterns (circuit breaker)
* DB migrations
* NoSql
* Microservice patterns
* Event Sourcing
* Message queue patterns
* Reactive design 
* Scalability patterns

Note: 
* uService ‎- discovery, monitoring, containerization, scheduling ...
* Resiliency - how to test at that layer
* how to test db integration layer´
* scalability at the service and infrastructure layers
---

## CQRS
#### Command Query Responsability Segregation

Note:
* CQS at the architectural level
* Reads and writes through different channels
* single source of truth
* event propagation on state changes
* REACT a bit like this on the UI layer

---
## Tools

* Code Quality Analysis 
* Code change trend analysis
* Linters
* ‎Build scripting
* Package managers
* Static analysis tools

---
### Code Quality/Change Trend Analysis

#### Tools like Code-Maat and SonarQube

Note:
* Sonar Qube stores code metrics and analysis histroically
* Code-maat checks for code coupling trends and change motivation
---
## Value Processes

* Event storming 
* Value stream mapping
* Impact mapping
* Maturity model evaluations

---
### Event Storming

<div id="left" class="eventstorming">
![Event Storming Book](assets/images/eventstorming.book.page.1.png)
</div>

<div id="right">
<ul>
    <li>Physical software modeling technique</li>
    <li>Excelent for project inception phases</li>
    <li>Domain events and Aggregate exploration</li>
    <li>Helps find Bounded contexts and subdomains, too</li>
</ul>
</div>

Note:
* Sticky note based
* Low tech, low cost techinique
* everyone participates
* Maps beautifully to DDD concepts
* Check out Alberto Brandolini's work on this
* even when done poorly, It still brings in a lot of value

---

## People Skills & Personal Development

* Writing
* "‎Captains Log"
* Empathy 
* Management & Leadership Skills
* Team & Communication Skills
* Learning Organizations
 
---

## You can choose topics that are not on this list

---

## Commit to it throughout the year

---

## ...but it's OK to change throughout the year

(that's ok)

---

## Sounds easy right?

---

## I hear too often "I don't have the time"

(I sometimes say it too)

---

# How to find the time?

---

## Some techniques:

*  Lunch and Learn
*  Group gatherings
*  Mix activities
*  Mix it into work
*  YOU time (schedule it!)

NOTE: 
(mix and match)
If you know any good ones that work for you , PLEASE DO SHARE 

---

## Lunch and Learn
### (4 ways to do it)

Note:
* Classic : Someone brings a theme and a short presentations, and presents at lunch hour.
all you need is some projector. everyone typically needs to eat lunch
* Variation 1: 
Just watch a tutorial or conference presentation at lunch (in group)
0 cost, guaranteed info ingestion
* Variation 2
A bit more formal, and reduced time limite (15)
a.k.a Speed Training
* Variation 3
While having lunch, watch some tutorial or presentation

---

#### ~ 40 hours per year of learning if you do it once a week.
(1/5th of the 5-Hour rule)

---

## Group Gatherings

Go To Conferences, Workshops and Meetups

Note:
* Our meetup is 2 hours of monthly-ish learning.
* Social aspect enables some interesting things in our brains
* take it a step further and organize one

--- 

## Habit of reading books

Note:
Challenge Adendum : Book challenge
* at least one tech book per year / semester / quarter
* fiction plus non fiction
* ‎book group / swap
* start a company library

---

## Mix Activities 
### (examples)

* read books on your comute
* listen to podcasts while you drive
* listen to audio books while you excercise
* watch a presentation while you cook
* toilet reading

NOTE: 
The idea is to do regular daily stuff (not cognitively expensive) with information ingestion

* Learning requires focus. You can't focus if you mix activities that require attention. 
* Multitasking is expensive
* Consider only activities that do not require great attention
* consider mixing senses (amygdala is connected to the hippocampus)

---

### Mix it into work

On the job, deliberately

* katas
* tutorials
* Q&A
* blog post reading and indexing
* documenting and sharing learnings
* link sharing

---

### Pairing at work

Learn what other do by working with them, or help them acheive their goals
* a dev can work with ops on on-call duty
* a dev can automate some unautomated process
* a dev can do customer support

Note:
Volunteer for it

---

### Improving at work

* Using 1-on-1s and Mentoring
* Logging work and discoveries
* Learning retrospectives
* Portmortems to blamelessly learn from failure
* 20% time projects or hack-a-thons

---

## You time

#### Ultimately, you (may) need to schedule time for learning

Note:
deliberately set the time aside (like a meeting) 

---
 
## Bring others along for the ride

Note:
Like running, learning efforts can benefit from having others around you, pushing you forward and feeding from your effort.
Careful, others may reduce efficiency if not focused / committed.

---

## Bring your organization along

Note:
Is your company a learing organization? Can you be the one who helps transform it into one?
* concept of learning org is more then this, obviously, but it's a step in that direction

---

## Your company IS accountable for your training

Note:
Both by law and by interest.

Lobby for your training if you are not getting it.
* get to workshops and conferences
* get them to buy the books
* get them to subsscribe to training sites (Lynda, Pluralsight, Mapt, Safari, Udemy...)

---

## YOU are accountable for your training

Note:
* You SHOULD buy books and videos
* You SHOULD go to confrences and workshops
* You should be able to afford these things... If not, something is fundamentally wrong. 

---

## You OWN your career. 
It solely up to you. Your company may help/ your colleagues and friends may help, but it is up to you...

---

## In 2018, go learn something new!
