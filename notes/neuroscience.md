Overview

* Tap into potential
* Mindset : Fixed vs Growth
* * Brain is elastic, so growth is ALWAYS possible
* * Growth mindset => continuous improvement
* "YET" is a keyword in growth

## Kolbs Learning Cycle

Walk people around the model when teaching

--- 

# 3 phases (Britt Andreata)

LEARN - REMEMBER - DO

---

# LEARN:
* levels
* cycle
* requires focus (turns on the hippocampus)

---

# REMEMBER:
- connections
* feelings
* retreival (3 with sleep)

---


Brainwise:
* amygdala - translate senses
* hippocampus - captures senses info and generates memories

Hippocampus can do about 20 minutes of intense focus
- note taking helps
- multitasking does not

--- 

Metacognition
* links
* insights are not lost (how do we take people to insight) insights stick!
* * people doing their own learning tends to stick
* * requires some quite time (walking, nature, shower, ...) - brain needs rest time for connections to occur
* social connections / social learning - enables positive emotions and social part of brain - collaborative learning is more powerful
* music is a memory enabler - it touches many regions of the brain

---

Feelings
* through the amygdala (detects stimulae)
* * activates hippocampus to remeber in "survival mode"
* some feelings are more likely o turn on learning
* slightly positive is th sweet spot forlearning

---

Best for learning:
* games
* sharing
* insight / aha moment
* application / reflection
* quiz
* light competition

---

There is also the "troika": (positive arousal)
* Gratitude
* Mindfulness
* Humor

---

Retrieval

* Repetition itself is not the key
* the more you use / activate memories, the stronger the neurons grows
* changing the context helps grow the memory
* play with retreival batch to make learning stick
* sleep is a key element to allow the brain to reactivate neuron paths (REM sleep and last hour of sleep are key - waking up naturally is key to maximize the learning)
* How to maximize retrieval + sleep combination

---

"Magic of three"
* use 3 levels of bloom in desiging learning
* attempt to connect 3 different things
* 3 retrievals with sleep in between

---

# DO
* trigger (observable)
* baby steps
* reward 

---

Habits are key here (Power of habits - book...)
* habits goes into the baselganglia to activate without thinking

Habits:
* CUE -> Routine -> Reward

building habits to chang behaviour (and enhance learning)
* You only need to reward unitl the habit is created
* social rewards -> Oxytocine?

Designing behaviour change -> habit design
* repetiitions do matter for habits
