Cultivating Potential

"Greiner Curve" for acessing oranization
* 6 phases
* crisis points between phases that force change

Phases:
1 - Growth through creativity (small)
-> leadership crisis
2 - Growth through direction
-> crisis point of autonomy
3 - Growht through delegation (management layers)
-> crisis point of control
4 - Growth through Coordination + Monitoring
-> red.tape crisis
5 - Growth through collaboration
-> internal growth crisis
6 - Growth through aliances
-> crisis point of identity

diferent parts of org can be in different phases and points

---

* After assessment -> design the learning
* Map learning strategy to Greiner curve
* Map to current and upcoming stages
* dif programs for emplyees, managers and leaders

* possible to preditc emplyee attrition to the different phases
- may be predicter of leaves
- augment retaining

--- 

L&D needs to be mor like consultants / partners 
* 2 way relationship
* ask a lot of questions to know what challenges are to be addressed (and be more eficient)
* design and deliver solutiosn that create results

"Learning is a key factor in increasing employee engagement and attracting top talent"

Add info to the learning matrix with data for current and desired states.

* HiPo => High potential Talent
* preping succesors => next man up

"cost of replacing an employee is 50 -250 % of their salary and benefits"
entry level -> 50-%  | high skill => 250%

"cost of disengagement" 
(17.2% in US are disengaged)
(estimate 34% of salary is lost due to diengagement)

"increases employee identification with componany culture"

---

# Culture of learning

"honor the ever present nature of learning"
"value learning as a path to mastery"
"stumbles are important -> create a culture where taking risks is ok. celebrate "aha" moments."
"managers need to know how to coach"
"value growth and improvement in performance reviews"
"assess every employees growth - 1/4 of the assessment"
"make learning easy and accessable"
"blended learning maximizes options"

---

# Adult learning theory (Andorgogy)

* self directed (more freedon)
* driven by internal motivation

Design:
* Honor wide range of backgournds and experiencies
* self directed experiencies
* contextualized learning (why and how to apply to own life)

---

# Bloom's levels of learning

(higher order thinking)
Creating | Evaluatinf | anazlyzing
Applying
Understanding
Remebering (low level)

# appreciative Inquiry

focus in and build on current knowledg and experiÃªnce

# Neuroscience of learning

3 Phase model: LEARN -> REMEMBER -> DO

Hippocampis -> responsable for memory (limit of what it can hold, 20 min max)
- space activities every 15 minutes

Amygdala -> major senses into amygdala, activates hippocampus

Schemas (brain categorizes things)
- atach new learning to existing schemas in the brain
- insight is the most powerful form of learning

Basal Ganglia
- Instinctive action / habits
- habit design is a learning maximizier
- learning changes behaviour

Neuroplasticity
- continually growing new neuropaths
"Britt's book: "wired to grow"

# Creating Real behaviour change

* Id habits you want to instill in employees
* design learning solution to take employee from behaviour a to b

* Help learners practice to form habit

--- 

# HABIT
Cue -> Routine -> Reward

---

# designing solutions
* design to work naturally for the brain
* make learning acessible and relevant

## On-Demand Learning

## Instruction 
* (by showing)

### 70-20-10 Model:
70% on the job (tough jobs)
20% social interactions (people)
10% informal learning events (training)

some have used the model to down-play on importance of formal training

Available learning should be relevant to learner, accessable and effective and driving behavour change

---

# assessing the audience

stakeholders views - leaders and audience
need to fill the gap
map learning to both perspectives
address the real stuff -> needs, context and perspectives
change is emotional => give some emotional inteligence skills

# Story arc
begginging -middle -end
"learners going on a journey"

aha moments create permenant neural changes

# Creating insights
Why-How-Try to create Insights

#format and delivery

* blendend learning
* flipped classroom
- video for pre and post learning with hands on in between

## Formats:
* Static vs adaptive
* Structured vs Unstructured
* Synchronous or asyncronous (for the group of lernings)
* Online vs. Offline
* Off-The-Shelf vs. Bespoke (customized)
* Self-Paced vs Instructor led
* Indivisual vs. Collaborative

---

# Critical nature of practice

* turn neural pathways into habits
* struggle to find practice time, so practice time needs to be done in the training due to their value
* model ideal behaviour (www.practice.xyz) / role play (immersive training simulators)
* Adaptive learning

---

# Off-TheShelf vs Bespoke (Custom) Solutions

* check if they map to the Greiner Curve
* what flexibility is available for add-ons and changes
* verify copyright context
* what customization is available (customizable aproximates to company culture)
* does it drive the behaviour change expected?
* does it have a good story ark?
* mix and match (blend)
* flexibility + accessability

---

# Learning program systems (LMS)

* tooling and tracking
* delivery

---

# Learning Program Processes

* partership process (coordination)
* design team (create learning solutions)
* project management process
* asset management
* marketing (internal anouncements)
* comunications team
* who will delivery / facilitate the content
* * facilitator management system
* data collection (for evaluation)
* legal

team will grow as learning process grows

---

# curating content

* curating content for learners
* * helps expand learning options and info
* * book chapters, books and articles

## for every solution, curate aditional learning

Curation ideas:
* curate articles on topic
* research (choos stuff from leaders)
* books (print + audio)
* * look for licensing options
* videos (playlists)
* Ted talks
* podcasts
* websites

VET everything first! (guarantee quality)

* consider how to store and house content (website portal)

# Evaluation Methods

ROI of Learning (Jack Philips)
* ROI (highest level)
* Impact
* Implementation
* Learning
* Reaction / Satisfations (basic level)

Reaction : did they like it?
Learning: Did the learn
Implementaiton: Were they able to deploy the learning on the job (behaviour change)
Impact: did it impact business results
ROI: did the investment payoff?

## ROI:
* Benefit / cost ratio
* as a percentage
* Time to PAyoff (how long the investment in learning took to pay for itself)

COSTs:
Cost / -Output / Time / Quality / eneryg
customer service / creativity / development / culture
